Hi,

I finally made plugin and themes as per your reuqiremnt.
Paradise.zip and wp-fixed-text are both theme and plugin respectively.

if this file not work I provide full wordpress website with sql files. so you have to 

1. connect yashtheme.sql file must be upload to phpmyadmin panel.
	by deafult wp-cnfig 

	/** The name of the database for WordPress */
	define('DB_NAME', 'yashtheme');

	/** MySQL database username */
	define('DB_USER', 'root');

	/** MySQL database password */
	define('DB_PASSWORD', '');

	/** MySQL hostname */
	define('DB_HOST', 'localhost');

	you have to be change this detail as per your localhost information(phpmyadmin,database username password).

2.then confighure this wordpress file to database and localhost to start wordpress website and see properly.


if it is not fully work you may put request to me on my email yash27095@gmail.com

Thanks:-)
